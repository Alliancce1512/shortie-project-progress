# Shortie - URL Shortener with Statistics

Shortie is a full-stack URL shortener built with a modern frontend (via Loveable.dev), n8n backend, and PostgreSQL database. It supports shortened links, secret stat pages, daily uniques, top IPs tracking, and is fully self-hosted on a VPS with SSL.

---

## ‚ú® Demo

You can try to generate short links by yourself or use these pre-generated links:

- [Live Website](https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu)
- [Short URL](https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu/r/uqzsre)
- [Statistics URL](https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu/s/1ccd40a7f6be5c1da48d)

## üöÄ Features

- URL shortening with format validation and length limits
- Secret statistics URL generation (hard to guess)
- Visit logging with IP address and `X-Forwarded-For` support
- Unique visits per day tracking
- Top 10 IPs by total opens
- Dark/light mode support with persistent theme
- Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)

---

## üß† Architecture Overview

- Users submit a long URL via the frontend
- Backend (n8n) generates:
  - A short URL (for redirect)
  - A secret URL (for viewing stats)
- Generated short and secret codes are stored in the `urls` table
- Visits are logged in `visits` table
- Unique IPs per day are stored in `daily_uniques`
- Frontend dynamically loads and visualizes stats

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Setup

To create the necessary database tables, run the following SQL file:

```bash
psql -U <your_db_user> -d <your_db_name> -f schema.sql
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run and Use

To run and use the project locally or on your own VPS:

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alliancce1512/shortie-project-progress.git
cd shortie-project-progress
```

### 2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. **Run the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 4. **Production Build**
```bash
npm run build
```

Then deploy the `dist/` folder to your server (e.g. `/var/www/shortie`)  
CI/CD is already preconfigured via **GitHub Actions + SSH**.

## üîß Backend (n8n) Workflows (Reference)

The backend logic is implemented via **n8n**, a visual automation tool that acts as a logic layer for link generation, redirection, tracking, and stats. The production instance is self-hosted and not publicly available for security reasons.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Even though the backend isn't exposed, the system is fully testable via live demo links and well-documented endpoints.

### ‚úÖ Active Workflows

| Workflow               | Method | Path                                       | Purpose                                     |
|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Create Short URL       | POST   | `/shortie/shorten-url`                     | Receives long URL, returns short & stat URLs |
| Redirect to Long URL   | GET    | `/shortie/redirect/:shortCode`             | Logs IP, adds visit, and redirects           |
| Secret Page Redirect   | GET    | `/shortie/stats/:secretCode`               | Redirects to frontend stats page             |
| Return Stats JSON      | GET    | `/shortie/stats/:secretUrl`                | Returns top IPs + daily visits in JSON       |

### üì• Request / Response (Create URL)

**POST** `/shortie/shorten-url`
```json
{
  "longUrl": "https://example.com"
}
```

**Response:**

      { "date": "2025-06-22", "count": "2" }
    ],
    "topIps": [

  }

## üîê Code Generation & Security

### Short Code (`/r/<shortCode>`)
- Generated using a short random alphanumeric string:
  ```js
  Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8)
  ```
- Used for redirecting to the original URL
- Example: `https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu/r/uqzsre`

### Secret Code (`/s/<secretCode>`)
- Generated with a hashed SHA256 of the long URL + random salt:
  ```js
  SHA256(longUrl + '-' + Math.random()) ‚Üí HEX
  ```
- First 20 characters of the hash are taken for brevity:
  ```js
  secretCode = $input.first().json.secretCode.substring(0, 20)
  ```
- This guarantees that even if the same URL is shortened by different users, they get different stats links
- Example: `https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu/s/1ccd40a7f6be5c1da48d`

### SSL Certificate
- All endpoints are secured via HTTPS
- Managed by Let's Encrypt using NGINX configuration on a VPS

### IP Tracking
- IPs are recorded via `X-Forwarded-For` header for accuracy behind proxies
- Tracked for:
  - Total visits
  - Daily unique visits (by IP + day)
  - Top IPs accessing each link

## üöß Known Limitations

- The backend (n8n) is self-hosted and not accessible for direct public usage
- No authentication or rate limiting implemented
- No UI for managing previously created links beyond session cache

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Rebuild backend in Node.js/Express or NestJS for full-stack control
- Add pagination and filtering for large-scale analytics
- Save short + secret links in browser localStorage or user profiles
- Add automated unit and integration tests
- Add multi-language support
- Add admin panel to moderate or manage all shortened URLs
