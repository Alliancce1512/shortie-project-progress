# Shortie - URL Shortener with Statistics

Shortie is a full-stack URL shortener built with a modern frontend (via Loveable.dev), n8n backend, and PostgreSQL database. It supports shortened links, secret stat pages, daily uniques, top IPs tracking, and is fully self-hosted on a VPS with SSL.

## ✨ Demo

You can try to generate short links by yourself or use these pre-generated links:

- 🔹 [Website](https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu)

- 🔸 [Short URL](https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu/r/uqzsre)
- 🔹 [Statistics URL](https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu/s/1ccd40a7f6be5c1da48d)

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

- Users submit a long URL via the frontend
- Backend (n8n) generates:
  - A short URL (for redirect)
  - A secret URL (for viewing stats)
- Generated short and secret codes are stored in the `urls` table
- Visits are logged in `visits` table
- Unique IPs per day are stored in `daily_uniques`
- Frontend dynamically loads and visualizes stats

## 🔐 Code Generation & Security

### Short Code (`/r/<shortCode>`)
- Generated using a short random alphanumeric string:
  ```js
  Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8)
  ```
- Used for redirecting to the original URL
- Example: `https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu/r/uqzsre`

### Secret Code (`/s/<secretCode>`)
- Generated with a hashed SHA256 of the long URL + random salt:
  ```js
  SHA256(longUrl + '-' + Math.random()) → HEX
  ```
- First 20 characters of the hash are taken for brevity:
  ```js
  secretCode = $input.first().json.secretCode.substring(0, 20)
  ```
- This guarantees that even if the same URL is shortened by different users, they get different stats links
- Example: `https://shortie.presiyangeorgiev.eu/s/1ccd40a7f6be5c1da48d`

### SSL Certificate
- All endpoints are secured via HTTPS
- Managed by Let's Encrypt using NGINX configuration on a VPS

### IP Tracking
- IPs are recorded via `X-Forwarded-For` header for accuracy behind proxies
- Tracked for:
  - Total visits
  - Daily unique visits (by IP + day)
  - Top IPs accessing each link
